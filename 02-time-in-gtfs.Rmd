# Transit Frequencies

## bustt package

[`bustt`](https://github.com/r-transit/bustt) is a package for working with time in transit schedule data. In particular, it is focused on questions like: 

- What are the headway of train lines at 59-Street Columbus Circle on Saturdays?
- What are the typical headway characteristics of the A Train on weekdays?

### Installation

You can install this package from CRAN with:

```
install.packages("bustt")
```

## Calculate Frequency

### Attach Required Packages

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(trread)
library(bustt)
```

### Import Data

Note that you can replace the URL below with any other transit agency GTFS URL.  

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}
NYC <- import_gtfs("http://web.mta.info/developers/data/nyct/subway/google_transit.zip")
```

### Headway Statistics along a Route

List the routes with the shortest median headways. 

```{r}
route_frequency_summary <- route_frequency(NYC) %>%
  arrange(median_headways)

head(route_frequency_summary)
```

### Stop Headway Statistics

List the stops with the shortest headways in the system. 

```{r}
stop_frequency_summary <- stop_frequency(NYC, by_route=FALSE) %>%
  inner_join(NYC$stops_df) %>%
    select(stop_name, headway) %>%
      arrange(headway)

head(stop_frequency_summary)
```
